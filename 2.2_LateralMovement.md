## Azure VMs - User Data


- Scripts or any other data that can be inserted on an Azure VM at time of provision or later.

- "Any application on the virtual machine can access the user data from the Azure Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) after provision."
- User data is:
  - Persistent across reboots
  - Can be retrieved and updated without affecting the VM
  - Not encrypted and any process on the VM can access the data!
  - Should be base64 encoded and cannot be more than 64KB

#### Azure VMs - User Data - Abuse

- Despite clear warning in the documentation, a lot of sensitive information can be found in user data.

- Examples are, PowerShell scripts for domain join operations, post-provisioning configuration and management, on-boarding agents, scripts used by infrastructure automation tools etc.
- It is also possible to modify user data with permissions "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/write" on the target VM. Any automation or scheduled task reading commands from user data can be abused!
- Modification of user data shows up in VM Activity Logs but doesn't show what change was done.

- Retrieve user data:
```
$userData = Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"Metadata"="true"} -Method GET -Uri
"http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance/compute/userData?api-version=2021-01-01&format=text"
[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($userData))
```

- Modify user data:
```
$data = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("whoami"))
$accessToken = (Get-AzAccessToken).Token
$Url = "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/b413826f-108d-4049-8c11- d52d5d388768/resourceGroups/RESEARCH/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/jumpvm?api-version=2021-07-01"
$body = @(
@{
location = "Germany West Central"
properties = @{
userData = "$data"
}
}
) | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4


$headers = @{
Authorization = "Bearer $accessToken"
}
# Execute Rest API Call
$Results = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Put -Uri $Url -Body $body -Headers $headers -ContentType 'application/json'
```

### Azure VMs - Custom Script Extension

- Extensions are "small applications" used to provide post deployment configuration and other management tasks. OMIGOD!

- Custom Script Extension is used to run scripts on Azure VMs.

- Scripts can be inline, fetched from a storage blob (needs managed identity) or can be downloaded.

- The script is executed with SYSTEM privileges.

- Can be deployed to a running VM.

- Only one extension can be added to a VM at a time. So it is not possible to add multiple custom script extensions to a single VM.

#### Azure VMs - Custom Script Extension - Abuse

- Following permissions are required to create a custom script extension and read the output:
- ```Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/write``` and
- ```Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/extensions/read```

- The execution of script takes place almost immediately.

## Azure VMs - Azure AD Devices

Three types of device identities
-  Azure AD joined
  -  Organization owned devices and heavily managed using Intune or Configuration Manager
  -  Only Windows 11 and 10 and Server 2019 machines running on Azure
  -  Can be accessed using Azure AD account
-  Azure AD registered/workplace joined
  -  Can be user owned (BYOD) or organization owned. Lightly managed
  -  Windows 10 or newer. macOS, Ubuntu and mobile devices
-  Hybrid Azure AD joined
  -  Organization owned devices joined to on-prem AD and registered with Azure AD
  -  All supported Windows Desktop and Server versions


  #### Azure VMs - Azure AD joined machines


- When a machine is joined to Azure AD, following users/roles are made a member of the local administrators group for management
  - Global Administrators
  - Azure AD Joined Device Local Administrator
  - User who joined the machine to Azure
- Other Azure users can also be joined to local administrators group of Azure AD joined machines.

## Primary Refresh Token (PRT)

- Recall that refresh tokens can be used to request new access tokens for a particular application.
- PRT is a special refresh token used for single sign-on (SSO)!
- It can be used to obtain access and refresh tokens to any application.
- Issued to a user for a specific device
- Valid for 90 days and is continuously renewed
- CloudAP SSP requests and caches PRT on a device
- If PRT is MFA-based (Windows Hello or Windows Account manager), then the claim is transferred to app tokens to prevent MFA challenge for every application.
- Before a fix in August 2021, PRT always had MFA claims.

#### Azure VMs - PRT

- If we compromise an Azure AD joined (or Hybrid joined) machine, it is possible to extract PRT and other keys for a user.
- For Azure AD Registered machine, PRT is issued if a user has added a secondary work account to the device.

#### Lateral Movement - Pass-the-PRT
- If we have access to a PRT, it is possible to request access tokens for any application.
- Chrome uses BrowserCore.exe to use PRT and request PRT cookie for SSO experience.
- This PRT cookie - ```x-ms-RefreshTokenCredential``` - can be used in a browser to access any application as the user whose PRT we have.

#### Lateral Movement - Extracting PRT

- Azure AD makes use of nonce for request validation. We need to request a nonce to extract PRT:
```
$TenantId = "2d50cb29-5f7b-48a4-87ce-fe75a941adb6"
$URL = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$TenantId/oauth2/token"

$Params = @{
"URI"    = $URL "Method" = "POST"
}

$Body = @{
"grant_type" = "srv_challenge"
}

$Result = Invoke-RestMethod @Params -UseBasicParsing -Body $Body
$Result.Nonce
```

#### Lateral Movement - Extracting PRT


- We can extract PRT by using the below tools in a session of the target Azure AD user:
- ROADToken
```C:\AzAD\Tools\ROADToken.exe <nonce>```
- AADInternals
```Get-AADIntUserPRTToken```

- We could also use Mimikatz or its variants (like pypykatz) to extract the PRT and other secrets (Session Key and Clear key).

Please note that in the lab, we are using SessionExecCommand to run ROADToken in context of the user Michael Barron.

#### Lateral Movement - Pass-the-PRT

- Once we have the PRT cookie, copy the value from previous command and use it with Chrome web browser
- Open the Browser in Incognito mode
- Go to https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf
- Press F12 (Chrome dev tools) -> Application -> Cookies
- Clear all cookies and then add one named `x-ms-RefreshTokenCredential` for https://login.microsoftonline.com and set its value to that retrieved from AADInternals
- Mark HTTPOnly and Secure for the cookie
- Visit https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf again and we will get access as the user!
-  Note that a location based Conditional Access Policy would block Pass-the-PRT whereas a “require compliant and/or Azure AD joined device” policy is bypassed.

## Device Management - Intune
- Intune is a Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Mobile Application Management (MAM) service.
- Intune needs an Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 license.
- For devices to be fully managed using Intune, they need to be enrolled.
- Enrolled devices (IsCompliant or Compliant set to Yes in Azure Portal) allow
- Access control using Conditional Access Policies
- Control installed applications, access to information, setup threat protection agents etc.

#### Lateral Movement - Intune - Cloud to On-Prem

- Using the Endpoint Manager at https://endpoint.microsoft.com/, a user with Global Administrator or Intune Administrator role can execute PowerShell scripts on an enrolled Windows device.
- The script runs with privileges of SYSTEM on the device. We do not get to see the script output and the script doesn't run again if there is no change.
- As per documentation, the script execution takes place every one hour but in my experience that is random.


### Dynamic Groups

- We can create rules - based on user or device properties - to automatically join them to a Dynamic group.
- For example, an organization may add users to a particular group based on their userPrincipalName, department, mail etc.
- When a group membership rule is applied, all users and device attributes are evaluated for matches.
- When an attribute changes for a user or device, all dynamic group rules are checked for a match and possible membership changes.
- No Azure AD roles can be assigned to a Dynamic Group but Azure RBAC roles can be assigned.
- Dynamic groups requires Azure AD premium P1 license.

#### Dynamic Groups - Abuse

- By default, any user can invite guests in Azure AD.
- If a dynamic group rule allows adding users based on the attributes that a guest user can modify, it will result in abuse of this feature.
- There are two ways the rules can be abused
- Before joining a tenant as guest. If we can enumerate that a property, say mail, is used in a rule, we can invite a guest with the email ID that matches the rule.
- After joining a tenant as guest. A guest user can 'manage their own profile', that is, they can modify manager and alternate email. We can abuse a rule that matches on Manager (Direct Reports for "{objectID_of_manager}") or alternative email (user.otherMails -any (_ -contains "string"))



## Application Proxy



- Application Proxy allows access to on-prem web applications after sign-in to Azure
AD.
- Application proxy has following components
- Endpoint - This is the external URL that the users browse to access the on-prem
application. External users must authenticate to AAD
- Application Proxy Service - This services runs in the cloud and passes the token provided by Azure AD to the on-prem connector

- Application Proxy Connector - This is an agent that runs on the on-prem infrastructure and acts as a communication agent between the cloud proxy service and on-prem application. It also communicates with the on-prem AD in case of SSO
- On-prem application - The application that is exposed using application proxy


## Application Proxy

#### Application Proxy - Abuse

- Compared to directly exposing an on-prem app, application proxy does provide additional security (authentication handled by Azure AD, Conditional Access etc.)
- But, it does NOT help if the on-prem application has code or deployment related vulnerabilities.

#### Lateral Movement - Application Proxy - Cloud to On-Prem




-  We can enumerate the applications that has application proxy configured using the Azure AD module (may take a few minutes to complete):
```
Get-AzureADApplication | %{try{Get-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication - ObjectId $_.ObjectID;$_.DisplayName;$_.ObjectID}catch{}}
```

-  Get the Service Principal (Enterprise Application):
```
Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | ?{$_.DisplayName -eq "Finance Management System"}
```

-  Use Get-ApplicationProxyAssignedUsersAndGroups.ps1 to find users and groups assigned to the application:
```
. C:\AzAD\Tools\Get-ApplicationProxyAssignedUsersAndGroups.ps1
```

-  Use Get-ApplicationProxyAssignedUsersAndGroups.ps1 to find users and groups assigned to the application. Pass the ObjectID of the Service Principal to it:
```
Get-ApplicationProxyAssignedUsersAndGroups -ObjectId ec350d24-e4e4-4033- ad3f-bf60395f0362
```
