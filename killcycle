Compromised a user "Test", so first thing lets see what permissions we have - in Azure this will be groups and roles:

Get-AzureADUser -SearchString 'test' | Get-AzureADUserMembership
Get-AzureADUserMembership -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com

ok we get a randome GUID for the group, but what roles doe we have?
