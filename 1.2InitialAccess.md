# Initial Access
#### Password Spray/Brute Force
- We will use a single password against multiple users that we have enumerated.
- This is definitely noisy and may lead to detection!
- For Azure, password spray attack can be done against different API endpoints like Azure AD Graph, Microsoft Graph, Office 365 Reporting webservice etc


#### MSOLSpray 
https://github.com/dafthack/MSOLSpray

We use MSOLSpray for password spray against the accounts that we discovered previously.
- The tool supports fireprox to rotate source IP address on auth request https://github.com/ustayready/fireprox

```
Import-Module C:\AzAD\Tools\MSOLSpray\MSOLSpray.ps1
