A normal user has many interesting permissions in Azure AD!

- Read non-hidden Group memberships
- Add guests to Owned groups
- Create new application
- Add up to 50 devices to Azure


#### AzureAD Module
•
AzureAD is a PowerShell module from Microsoft for managing Azure AD.
- Does not show all the properties of Azure AD objects and the documentation is not good. Still useful to some extent!
- Can be used only to interact with Azure AD, no access to Azure resources.
  
- Please note that if the module is not present on your machine, you can use Install Module AzureAD command (needs internet)
- or Download it from PowerShell Gallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureAD rename the .nukpkg to .zip and extract it
  
```
Import-Module C:\AzAD\Tools\AzureAD\AzureAD.psd1
```
