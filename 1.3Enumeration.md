# Enumeration

### Azure Portal
https://portal.azure.com
- The Azure Portal is a web console that can be used to manage Azure account and its resources.
- It is a GUI alternative to tools like PowerShell modules and Azure cli.

#### Default User Permissions
A normal user has many interesting permissions in Azure AD!
- Read all users, Groups, Applications, Devices, Roles, Subscriptions, and their public properties
- Invite Guests
- Create Security groups
- Read non-hidden Group memberships
- Add guests to Owned groups
- Create new application
- Add up to 50 devices to Azure

* * *

### Powershell foo
```|```  pipe

```|measure``` counts returned objects

```| fl``` format output to list 

```| fl *``` asterix means all properties are listed, including _Extension Properties_ which could have some interesting info


```?``` means ```Where``` condition - _Where is Powershell defacto filtering mechanism_

```$_``` means current object

```|?{$_.Displayname -match "admin"}``` means where the displayname value of the returned object matches "admin


Filter Azure AD Users by DisplayName:
```Get-AzureADUser | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like "*John*" }```

Check for a Specific Property Existence:
```Get-AzureADUser | Where-Object { $_.PSObject.Properties.Match("Department") }```

Search Text in Output:
```Get-AzureADUser | Select-String "john.doe@domain.com"```


Select specific properties of the returned object to display: ```| Select-Object -Property ProcessName, Id, WS``` is the same as ```| Select ProcessName, Id, WS```


* * * 

## AzureAD Module
AzureAD is a PowerShell module from Microsoft for managing Azure AD.

**NOTE:** _AAD Graph is more stealthy than MS Graph due to the latters additional security features so use AAD while you can_

Before the introduction of MS Graph there were no logs for any of the below enumeration - the only action that was logged was initial logon_

Identity is the perimiter for cloud - therefore the signin log is the goto 

- Does not show all the properties of Azure AD objects and the documentation is not good. Still useful to some extent!
- Can be used only to interact with Azure AD, no access to Azure resources.
- Please note that if the module is not present on your machine, you can use Install Module AzureAD command (needs internet)
- or Download it from PowerShell Gallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureAD rename the .nukpkg to .zip and extract it
  
```
Import-Module C:\AzAD\Tools\AzureAD\AzureAD.psd1
```
To be able to use PowerShell module, we must connect to Azure AD first:
```Connect-AzureAD```

- Using credentials from command line (PSCredential object can be used too)

```
$creds= Get-Credential
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds
```
OR
```
$passwd= ConvertTo-SecureString "V3ryH4rdt0Cr4ckN0OneCr4ckTh!sP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds= New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com", $passwd)
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds
```

* * * 

- Get the current session state:
```Get-AzureADCurrentSessionInfo```

- Get details of the current tenant:
```Get-AzureADTenantDetail```


#### AzureAD Module - Users
• Enumerate all users:
```Get-AzureADUser -All $true```

• Enumerate a specific user:
```Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com```

• Search for a user based on string in first characters of DisplayName or userPrincipalName (wildcard not supported):
```Get-AzureADUser -SearchString "admin"```

• Search for users who contain the word "admin" in their Display name:
```Get-AzureADUser -All $true |?{$_.Displayname -match "admin"}```

• List all the attributes for a user:
```Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com | fl * ```
OR
```Get-AzureADUser -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com |%{$_.PSObject.Properties.Name}```

• Search attributes for all users that contain the string "password" (unlikely, not seen in AAD like has been onprem):
```
Get-AzureADUser -All $true |%{$Properties =$_;$Properties.PSObject.Properties.Name | % {if($Properties.$_ -match 'password'){"$($Properties.UserPrincipalName) - $_ -$($Properties.$_)"}}}
```

•  All users who are synced from on-prem:
```Get-AzureADUser -All $true |?{$_.OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier -ne $null}```

•  All users who are from Azure AD:
```Get-AzureADUser -All $true | ?{$_.OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier -eq $null}```

•  Objects created by any user (use -ObjectId for a specific user):
```Get-AzureADUser | Get-AzureADUserCreatedObject```

•  Objects owned by a specific user (ownership is distinct from RBAC role):

**This is important because if you compromise a user who is the owner of an enterprise application, and that application has a Global Administrator role, you have effectively acquired GA**

=> if a low privilege user owns a high privilege object (i.e., an application service principal), that user is an attractive target, and it might not be immediately obvious to defenders either!

_this is what happened in Solar Winds hack - low priv user who owned a high privileged service principal object_

```
Get-AzureADUserOwnedObject -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com
```

#### AzureAD Module - Groups


•  List all Groups:
```Get-AzureADGroup -All $true```

•   Enumerate a specific group:
```Get-AzureADGroup -ObjectId 783a312d-0de2-4490-92e4-539b0e4ee03e```

•  Search for a group based on string in first characters of DisplayName (wildcard not supported):
```Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString "admin" | fl *```

• To search for groups which contain the word "admin" in their name:
```Get-AzureADGroup -All $true |?{$_.Displayname -match "admin"}```

•  Get Groups that allow Dynamic membership (Note the cmdlet name)
```Get-AzureADMSGroup | ?{$_.GroupTypes -eq 'DynamicMembership'}```

•  All groups that are synced from on-prem (note that security groups are not synced):
```Get-AzureADGroup -All $true | ?{$_.OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier -ne $null}```

•  All groups that are from Azure AD:
```Get-AzureADGroup -All $true | ?{$_.OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier -eq $null}```

•  Get members of a group:
```Get-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId 783a312d-0de2-4490-92e4-539b0e4ee03e```

•  Get groups and roles where the specified user is a member
```
Get-AzureADUser -SearchString 'test' | Get-AzureADUserMembership
Get-AzureADUserMembership -ObjectId test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com
```

#### AzureAD Module - Roles

•  Get all available role templates:
```Get-AzureADDirectoryroleTemplate```

•  Get all enabled roles (a user is assigned the role at least once):
```Get-AzureADDirectoryRole```

•  Enumerate users to whom roles are assigned:
```Get-AzureADDirectoryRole -Filter "DisplayName eq 'Global Administrator'" | Get-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember```

•  Get all Azure joined and registered devices
```Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | fl *```

•  Get the device configuration object (note the RegistrationQuota in the output):
```Get-AzureADDeviceConfiguration | fl *```

•  List all the active devices (and not the stale devices):
```Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | ?{$_.ApproximateLastLogonTimeStamp -ne $null}```

**PREVIEW MODULE**
```
Import-Module C:\AzAD\Tools\AzureADPreview\AzureADPreview.psd1
$passwd= ConvertTo-SecureString "V3ryH4rdt0Cr4ckN0OneCr4ckTh!sP@ssw0rd" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds= New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com", $passwd)
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds
```


• Get all non-built in roles:
```Get-AzureADMSRoleDefinition | ?{$_.IsBuiltin -eq $False}```


#### AzureAD Module - Devices

_In Azure the owner of a device is automatically a local admin - therefore everything a user owns you can access_

•    List Registered owners of all the devices:
```
Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | Get-AzureADDeviceRegisteredOwner
Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | %{if($user=Get-AzureADDeviceRegisteredOwner -ObjectId $_.ObjectID){$_;$user.UserPrincipalName;"`n"}}
```

•    List Registered users of all the devices:
```
Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | Get-AzureADDeviceRegisteredUser

```Get-AzureADUserOwnedDevice -ObjectId michaelmbarron@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com```


•    List devices registered by a user:
```Get-AzureADUserRegisteredDevice -ObjectId michaelmbarron@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com```


•    List devices managed using Intune:
```Get-AzureADDevice -All $true | ?{$_.IsCompliant -eq "True"}```

### AzureAD Module - Applications

One of the most confusing and important parts of Azure are applications. 
There are two types of applications:
- **App Registration**: Called "apps" in powershell - you want to use AzureAD Authentication to be able to access the app; the App Registration is the front facing configuration of the app - they can not be assigned any role..
- **Enterprise Application**: Called "Service Principal" in powershell - basically the service account for an app that can be assigned roles
  - Whenever somone wants to access an App registration App - an Enterprise App aka Service Principal will be created at runtime with the same name.
  - This is also true for multi-tenant - if the App Registration app is multi-tenant, there will be an Enterprise App aka Service Principal spun up in all applicable tenants, again with the same name
  - TLDR - App registrations are used when you want to use Azure AD Authentication for your own app.

note - a Managed Identity is actually a special type of Service Principal. 
- Service Principal is a fundamental concept in Azure AD, Managed Identity is built on top of this

Why are app registrations important from an attacker perspective? 
- If you have GA or are the owner of the app, you can add your own _client secret_ (application password), or federated identity; and acess the environment as the application with those created creds
  - no way to recover the masked creds in the app registration object within the portal
- you would also most likely avoid MFA when accesssing the env as an app/service principal
- try to not to use a user identity, try to use a service principal or an access token for these reasons (usually no MFA or conditional policy)

#### AzureAD Module - App Registrations

•   Get all the application objects registered with the current tenant (visible in App Registrations in
Azure portal). 
_An application object is the global representation of an app_
```
Get-AzureADApplication -All $true
```


•   Get all details about an application:
```Get-AzureADApplication -ObjectId a1333e88-1278-41bf-8145-155a069ebed0 | fl *```

•   Get an application based on the display name:
```Get-AzureADApplication -All $true | ?{$_.DisplayName -match "app"}```

•   The  Get-AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential will show the applications with an application password but password value is not shown. List all the apps with an application password:
```Get-AzureADApplication -All $true | %{if(Get- AzureADApplicationPasswordCredential -ObjectID $_.ObjectID){$_}}```

•  Get owner of an application
```Get-AzureADApplication -ObjectId a1333e88-1278-41bf-8145-155a069ebed0 | Get-AzureADApplicationOwner |fl *```

```Get-AzureADGroup -ObjectId 57ada729-a581-4d6f-9f16-3fe0961ada82 | Get-AzureADGroupAppRoleAssignment | fl *```


#### AzureAD Module - Service Principals

- Enumerate Service Principals (visible as Enterprise Applications in Azure Portal). 
  - Service principal is local representation for an app in a specific tenant and it is the security object that has privileges.
  -  _This is the 'service account'!_
  - Service Principals can be assigned Azure roles.
  - Even if you add a client secret to an app registration, when you authenticate it is the service principal that is authenticated, app registration is just a config.

•    Get all service principals:
```Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true```

```Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -ObjectId cdddd16e-2611-4442-8f45-053e7c37a264 | Get-AzureADServicePrincipalMembership |fl *```

## Enumeration -  Az Powershell


•  Az PowerShell is a module from Microsoft for managing Azure resources.

•  Please note that if the module is not present on your machine, you can use ```Install-Module Az``` command (needs internet).

•  "The Azure Az PowerShell module is a rollup module. Installing it downloads the generally available Az PowerShell modules, and makes their cmdlets available for use."

•  To be able to use PowerShell module, we must connect to Azure AD first: ```Connect-AzAccount```

•  Using credentials from command line (PSCredential object and access tokens can be used too)
```
$creds = Get-Credential
Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds
```

OR

```
$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "SuperVeryEasytoGuessPassword@1234" - AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential("test@defcorphq.onmicrosoft.com", $passwd)
Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds
