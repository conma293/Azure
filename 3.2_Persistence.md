# Persistence


- Like any other system, Azure provides many interesting persistence opportunities.
- Look for persistence, wherever we can modify or create a resource or permission or have an access that is not time limited.



Persistence - Hybrid Identity - On-Prem to Cloud




- It is recommended by Microsoft to join the Azure AD Connect server to the on-prem AD.
- This means that the persistence mechanisms for on-prem (like Golden Ticket, Silver Ticket, ACL Backdoors and others) that provide us either DA on the on- prem or local admin on the Azure AD connect server will allow to get GA on Azure AD on demand!
- For PHS, we can extract the credentials
- For PTA, we can install the agent
- For Federation, we can extract the certificate from ADFS server using DA


## Persistence - Federation - Trusted Domain




- If we have GA privileges on a tenant, we can add a new domain (must be verified), configure its authentication type to Federated and configure the domain to trust a specific certificate (any.sts in the below command) and issuer.
- Using AADInternals:
```
ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor -DomainName cyberranges.io
```

- Get ImmutableID of the user that we want to impersonate. Using Msol module
```
Get-MsolUser | select userPrincipalName,ImmutableID
```
- Access any cloud app as the user
```
Open-AADIntOffice365Portal -ImmutableID qIMPTm2Q3kimHgg4KQyveA== - Issuer "http://any.sts/B231A11F" -UseBuiltInCertificate -ByPassMFA $true
```


## Persistence - Federation - Token Signing Certificate


- With DA privileges on on-prem AD, it is possible to create and import new Token signing and Token Decryption certificates that have a very long validity.

- This will allow us to log-in as any user whose ImuutableID we know.
- Run the below command as DA on the ADFS server(s) to create new certs (default password 'AADInternals'), add them to ADFS, disable auto rollover and restart the service
```
New-AADIntADFSSelfSignedCertificates
```
- Update the certificate information with Azure AD
```
Update-AADIntADFSFederationSettings -Domain cyberranges.io
```

## Persistence - Storage Account Access Keys

- We already know that keys provide root equivalent privileges on an storage account.
- There are two access keys and they are NOT rotated automatically (unless a key vault is managing the keys).
- This, of course, provides neat persistent access to the storage account.
- We can also generate SAS URL (including offline minting) using the access keys.

## Persistence - Applications and Service Principals
- Azure AD Enterprise Applications (service principals) and App Registration (applications) can be used for persistence.
- With privileges of Application Administrator, GA or a custom role with microsoft.directory/applications/credentials/update permissions, we can add credentials (secret or certificate) to an existing application.
- By targeting an application with high permissions this is a very useful persistence mechanism.
- It also allows to bypass MFA!

## Persistence - Applications and Service Principals

- We can also add a new application that has high permissions and then use that for persistence.
- If we have GA privileges, we can create an application with the Privileged authentication administrator role - that allows to reset password of Global Administrators.

-  Sign in as a service principal using Az PowerShell (Use the application ID as the username, and the secret as password)
```
$passwd = ConvertTo-SecureString "J~Q~QMt_qe4uDzg53MDD_jrj_Q3P.changed" -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("311bf843-cc8b-459c-be24-6ed908458623", $passwd)
Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal -Credential $credentials -Tenant 2d50cb29-5f7b-48a4-87ce-fe75a941adb6
```


-  For certificate based authentication
```
Connect-AzAccount -ServicePrincipal -Tenant <TenantId> - CertificateThumbprint <Thumbprint> -ApplicationId <ApplicationId>
```


-  We can use az cli too to sign in as a service principal


## Persistence - Illicit Consent Grant


- By default, any user can register an application in Azure AD.
- We can register an application (only for the target tenant) that needs high impact permissions with admin consent - like sending mail on a user's behalf, role management etc.
- This will allow us to execute phishing attacks that would be very fruitful in case of success!


## Persistence - Azure VMs and NSGs

- OS level persistence on an Azure VM where we have remote access is very useful.
- Azure VMs also support managed identity so persistence on any such VM will allow us access to additional Azure resources.
- We can also create snapshot of disk attached to a running VM. This can be used to extract secrets stored on disk (like SAM hive for Windows).
- It is also possible to attach a modified/tampered disk to a turned-off VM. For example, add a local administrator!
- Couple this with modification of NSGs to allow access from IPs that we control!

Persistence - Custom Azure AD Roles

- If we have GA in a tenant, we can modify a custom role and assign that to a user that we control.
- Take a look at the permissions of the built-in administrative roles, we can pick individual actions. It is always helpful to go for minimal privileges.

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference

- For example, Actions allowed to Application Developer are good enough for a low-privilege persistence as they allow application registration even if - "Users can register applications" setting is set to No


## Persistence - Deployment Modification


- Recall the GitHub account that we compromised earlier.
- If we have persistent access to external resources like GitHub repos that are a part of deployment chain, it will be possible to persist in the target tenant.
- Often, a GitHub account would not have same level of security and monitoring compared to an Azure AD account with similar privileges!
- This is just an example, deployment modification has a huge attack surface!
