Password Spray/Brute Force
•
We will use a single password against multiple users that we have
enumerated.
•
This is definitely noisy and may lead to detection!
•
For Azure, password spray attack can be done against different API
endpoints like Azure AD Graph, Microsoft Graph, Office 365 Reporting
webservice etc
