Azure Kill Chain - Privilege Escalation

- Azure's automation service that allows to automate tasks for Azure resources, on-prem infra and other cloud providers.

- Supports Process Automation using Runbooks, Configuration Management (supports DSC), update management and shared resources (credentials, certificates, connections etc) for both Windows and Linux resources hosted on Azure and on-prem.
- Some common scenarios for automation as per Microsoft:
 - Deploy VMs across a hybrid environment using run books.
 - Identify configuration changes
 - Configure VMs
 - Retrieve Inventory


- Managed Identity is used to provide authentication for managing Azure resources.

- Now retired, Run As account used to have the Contributor role in the current subscription.

- Many organizations simply use the same permissions for the Managed Identity now.

- The Managed Identity can only be used from inside a Runbook, so Contributor on a Runbook = profit!








- Runbook contains the automation logic and code that you want to execute.
- Azure provides both Graphical and Textual (PowerShell, PowerShell Workflow and Python) Runbooks.

- You can use the Shared Resources (credentials, certificates, connections etc) and the privileges of the Run As account from a Runbook.
- Always checkout Runbooks! They often have credentials that are not stored in the shared resources.
- By default, only signed script can be run on a VM.
- Runbooks can run in Azure Sandbox or a Hybrid Runbook Worker.
- This is used when a Runbook is to be run on a non-azure machine.
- A user-defined hybrid runbook worker is a member of hybrid runbook
worker group.
- The Log Analytics Agent is deployed on the VM to register it as a hybrid worker.
- The hybrid worker jobs run as SYSTEM on Windows and nxautomation
account on Linux.


- Automation Account comes very handy in privilege escalation:
 - Usually, high privileges for the Managed Identity.
 - Often, clear-text credentials can be found in Runbooks. For example, a PowerShell runbook may have admin credentials for a VM to use PSRemoting.
 - Access to connections, key vaults from a runbook.
 - Ability to run commands on on-prem VMs if hybrid workers are in use.
 - Ability to run commands on VMs using DSC in configuration management.
