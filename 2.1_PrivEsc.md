# Automation Account
- Azure's automation service that allows to automate tasks for Azure resources, on-prem infra and other cloud providers.
- Supports Process Automation using Runbooks, Configuration Management (supports DSC), update management and shared resources (credentials, certificates, connections etc) for both Windows and Linux resources hosted on Azure and on-prem.
- Some common scenarios for automation as per Microsoft:
  - Deploy VMs across a hybrid environment using run books.
  - Identify configuration changes
  - Configure VMs
  - Retrieve Inventory
 
#### Automation Account - Managed Identity
- Managed Identity is used to provide authentication for managing Azure resources.
- Now retired, Run As account used to have the Contributor role in the current subscription.
- Many organizations simply use the same permissions for the Managed Identity now.
- The Managed Identity can only be used from inside a Runbook, so Contributor on a Runbook = profit!

#### Automation Account - Runbook
- Runbook contains the automation logic and code that you want to execute.
- Azure provides both Graphical and Textual (PowerShell, PowerShell Workflow and Python) Runbooks.
- You can use the Shared Resources (credentials, certificates, connections etc) and the privileges of the Run As account from a Runbook.
- Always checkout Runbooks! They often have credentials that are not stored in the shared resources.
- By default, only signed script can be run on a VM.
- Runbooks can run in Azure Sandbox or a Hybrid Runbook Worker.

#### Automation Account - Hybrid Worker
- This is used when a Runbook is to be run on a non-azure machine.
- A user-defined hybrid runbook worker is a member of hybrid runbook
worker group.
- The Log Analytics Agent is deployed on the VM to register it as a hybrid worker.
- The hybrid worker jobs run as SYSTEM on Windows and nxautomation
account on Linux.

#### Privilege Escalation - Automation Account
- Automation Account comes very handy in privilege escalation:
  - Usually, high privileges for the Managed Identity.
  - Often, clear-text credentials can be found in Runbooks. For example, a PowerShell runbook may have admin credentials for a VM to use PSRemoting.
  - Access to connections, key vaults from a runbook.
  - Ability to run commands on on-prem VMs if hybrid workers are in use.
  - Ability to run commands on VMs using DSC in configuration management.
 

# Key Vault
_Credential Manager in the cloud_
-  Azure service for storing secrets like passwords, connection strings, certificates, private keys etc.
-  With right permissions and access, Azure resources that support managed identities (VMs, App Service, Functions, Container etc.) can securely retrieve secrets from the key vault.
-  Object types available with a key vault:
- Cryptographic Keys - RSA, EC etc.
- Secrets - Passwords, connection strings
- Certificates - Life cycle management
- Storage account keys - Key vault can manage and rotate access keys for storage accounts

#### Key Vault - Identifier

-  Objects in a key vault are identified using Object Identifier URL.
-  The base URL is of the format :  https://{vault-name}.vault.azure.net/{object-type}/{object-name}/{object-version}
- vault-name is the globally unique name of the key vault
- object-type can be "keys", "secrets" or "certificates"
- object-name is unique name of the object within the key vault
- object version is system generated and optionally used to address a unique version of an object.
-  Access to a vault is controlled though two planes:
  - Management plane - To manage the key vault and access policies. Only Azure role based access control (RBAC) is supported.
  - Data plane - To manage the data (keys, secrets and certificates) in the key vault. This supports key vault access policies or Azure RBAC.
-  Please note that a role (like Owner) that has permissions in the management plane to manage access policies can get access to the secrets by modifying the access policies.
-  If we can compromise an azure resource whose managed identity can read secrets from a key vault (due to an access policy or assigned one of the capable roles or a custom role), it may be possible to gain access to more resources.
-  Note that each secret has its own IAM inherited from the KeyVault.
-  Overly permissive access policies may result in access to data stored in a vault.



# Enterprise Applications
-  Any application registered in Azure AD has two representations
- Application (in PowerShell terminology) object that is present only in the tenant where app is registered. This is visible under App Registrations in the Azure portal.
- Service Principal (in PowerShell terminology) that is present in every directory where application is used (in case of a multi-tenant application). This is visible under Enterprise Applications in the Azure portal. Azure RBAC roles use service principal.
-  "An application has one application object in its home directory that is referenced by one or more service principals in each of the directories where it operates (including the application's home directory)"
-  Service Principals (Enterprise Applications) are instances of the Application.

#### Enterprise Applications - Client Secrets

- An application object supports multiple client secrets (application passwords).
- A user that is owner or have application administrator role over an application can add an application password.
- An application password can be used to login to a tenant as a service principal. MFA is usually not applied on a service principal!

#### Enterprise Applications - Client Secrets - Abuse

- If we can compromise a user that has enough permissions to create a client secret/application password for an application object, we can
- Login as the service principal for that application
- Bypass MFA
- Access all the resources where roles are assigned to the service principal
- Add credentials to an enterprise applications for persistence after compromising a tenant

#### Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

- The 'infrastructure as code' service for Azure to deploy resources using code.
- ARM templates are JSON files containing deployment configuration for Azure resources.
- ARM templates also support a language called Bicep.

#### ARM Templates - History

- Each resource group maintains a deployment history for up to 800 deployments. The history is automatically deleted when the count exceeds 775 deployments.
- Deployment history is a rich source of information!
- Any user with permissions Microsoft.Resources/deployments/read and Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read can read the deployment history.
- Useful information can be extracted from deployment history.
- It gives us the ability to have information about the resources that are not presently deployed but may be deployed again in future!
- A deployment parameter that contains sensitive information like passwords should have 'SecureString' type. In case of a poorly written deployment template - that uses 'String' for such a parameter - we can get password in clear-text!

# Function App - Continuous Deployment

- Functions Apps (Azure Functions) support continuous deployment.

- In case continuous deployment is used, a source code update triggers a deployment to Azure.
- Following source code locations are supported
  - Azure Repos
  - GitHub
  - Bitbucket

- Deployment slots are supported so that deployments are first done in slots like staging (to avoid deploying directly in the default production slot)

#### Privilege Escalation - Function App - Continuous Deployment




- A misconfigured function app that deploys directly in production can be abused.
- In this case, if the source of truth/code location is compromised, it will be possible to assume the identity of the function app.
- For example, if GitHub is used as the provider, compromise of a GitHub account that can commit code will lead to compromise of the function app.
